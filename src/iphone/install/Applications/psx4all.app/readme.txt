v0.0.1 - Initial version

To install:
1. Unzip and extract psx4all.app to /Applications/ on your iPhone or iTouch.
2. You should now have a /Applications/psx4all.app/ directory with the supplied application files.
3. psx4iphone support the following game formats:
.ISO
.BIN ("RAW" rip from tools such as CDRDAO and CloneCD)
.IMG (such as from CloneCD)
.Z   (from PocketISO compressed BIN files)
.ZNX (from PocketISO compressed BIN files)
Currently NOT supported but will be soon:
.BZ
4. v0.0.5 and above allow for a BIOS to improve compatibility. 
The BIOS file scph1001.bin should be placed in /Applications/psx4all.app/
5. Games go in /var/root/Media/ROMs/PSX/
6. If that directory is not there, create it.
7. IMPORTANT! YOU MUST SET FILE PERMISSIONS OF THE FILE psx4all TO 755 OR YOU WILL GET A WHITE SCREEN WHEN TRYING TO RUN PSX4IPHONE!

To use:
1. Run psx4iphone and choose a ROM or goto Settings.
2. In Settings you can choose frameskip options, mute sound, and turn off the default interlacing.
3. After choosing a ROM, it will run. If a game is not compatible it will most likely crash to Springboard right about then.
4. Assuming the game format is correct and the game is compatible things will run now.
5. The default skin has L1 L2 MENU R2 R1 at the top. The bottom left has the dpad. The bottom right has the 4 PS1 hardbuttons in an 8way configuration so combos of the buttons can be used. The bottom middle has SELECT and START.
6. There is currently no support for save states. This will be fixed shortly. You CAN save via in-game saves to memory cards though!

Known issues:
1. Performance can be too slow. The dynarec is being worked on and performance should keep increasing.
2. Sound can be bad. This can be due to a few different issues, including poor performance.
3. Glitches in graphics can be due to some performance tweaks done by Unai of psx4all. Depending on reports from testers, they can be fixed.
